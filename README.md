# Clinical Data Repository (CDR) V2.0
# A data repository that houses all CIHP's historical and current daily clinical data for easy data access, manipulation, and interpretation for all needed reports 
# to the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC). 
# This is redesigned after the structure of the Nigeria Medical Record System (NMRS) 2.0 (https://github.com/nmrs-nigeria/openmrs-module-nigeriaemr) and is pulled from
# the original source code: https://github.com/henryvalentine/CDR
